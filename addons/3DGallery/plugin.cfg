name="3D Gallery"
description="3D Gallery is a Godot 4+ plugin that makes viewing imported 3D models easier.
Rather than clicking on each model to view it in the import popup, or adding it to a scene,
3D Gallery allows you to quickly scan through your filesystem previewing each model.
This comes in handy when you have a large number of models and want to flip through them quickly (ex. after purchasing an asset library).

3D will walk your project directory, looking for any Godot-supported 3D model formats:
	* .blend
	* .obj
	* .glb
	* .gltf
	* .fbx
	* .dae
It builds a filetree from there, allowing easy mouse or keyboard-based navigation to easily preview each model.

Controls:
* Arrow keys to navigate the gallery tree
* Left mouse click + drag to rotate the camera
* Right mouse click + drag to rotate the model on Y-axis
* Right mouse click + shift + drag to rotate the model on Z-axis
